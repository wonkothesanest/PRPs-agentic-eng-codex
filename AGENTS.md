# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to OpenAI Codex when working with code in this repository.

## Project Nature

This is a **PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) Framework** repository, not a traditional software project. The core concept: **"PRP = PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook"** - designed to enable AI agents to ship production-ready code on the first pass.

## Core Architecture

### Command-Driven System

- **Pre-configured Codex skills** in `.agents/skills/` (Codex users)
- **Pre-configured Claude Code commands** in `.claude/commands/` (Claude Code users)
- Skills organized by function:
  - Core PRP workflow: `prp-plan`, `prp-implement`, `prp-commit`, `prp-pr`, `prp-core-runner`
  - Research & debug: `prp-prd`, `prp-codebase-question`, `prp-debug`, `prp-issue-investigate`, `prp-issue-fix`
  - Review: `prp-review`, `prp-review-agents`
  - Specialized agents: `codebase-explorer`, `codebase-analyst`, `web-researcher`, `code-reviewer`, and more

### Template-Based Methodology

- **PRP Templates** in `PRPs/templates/` follow structured format with validation loops
- **Context-Rich Approach**: Every PRP must include comprehensive documentation, examples, and gotchas
- **Validation-First Design**: Each PRP contains executable validation gates (syntax, tests, integration)

### AI Documentation Curation

- `PRPs/ai_docs/` contains curated documentation for context injection
- `claude_md_files/` provides framework-specific AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md examples

## Development Commands

### PRP Execution

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for development)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --interactive

# Headless mode (for CI/CD)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --output-format json

# Streaming JSON (for real-time monitoring)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --output-format stream-json
```

### Key Codex Skills

**Core PRP Workflow (Recommended)**:
- `$prp-core-runner` - Orchestrate complete PRP workflow from feature to PR
- `$prp-plan` - Create comprehensive feature implementation plan with deep codebase analysis
- `$prp-implement` - Execute feature PRP with sequential validation
- `$prp-commit` - Create atomic git commit with validation
- `$prp-pr` - Push changes and create PR with comprehensive description

**Research & Debug**:
- `$prp-prd` - Interactive PRD generator
- `$prp-codebase-question` - Research codebase questions using parallel agents
- `$prp-debug` - Deep root cause analysis
- `$prp-issue-investigate` - Investigate a GitHub issue or problem
- `$prp-issue-fix` - Implement a fix from investigation artifact

**Review**:
- `$prp-review` - Comprehensive PR code review
- `$prp-review-agents` - Multi-agent review (7 aspects)

## Critical Success Patterns

### The PRP Methodology

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance

### PRP Structure Requirements

- **Goal**: Specific end state and desires
- **Why**: Business value and user impact
- **What**: User-visible behavior and technical requirements
- **All Needed Context**: Documentation URLs, code examples, gotchas, patterns
- **Implementation Blueprint**: Pseudocode with critical details and task lists
- **Validation Loop**: Executable commands for syntax, tests, integration

### Validation Gates (Must be Executable)

```bash
# Level 1: Syntax & Style
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Level 2: Unit Tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Level 3: Integration
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/endpoint -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}'

# Level 4: Deployment
# mcp servers, or other creative ways to self validate
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- L Don't create minimal context prompts - context is everything - the PRP must be comprehensive and self-contained, reference relevant documentation and examples.
- L Don't skip validation steps - they're critical for one-pass success - The better The AI is at running the validation loop, the more likely it is to succeed.
- L Don't ignore the structured PRP format - it's battle-tested
- L Don't create new patterns when existing templates work
- L Don't hardcode values that should be config
- L Don't catch all exceptions - be specific

## Working with This Framework

### When Creating new PRPs

1. **Context Process**: New PRPs must consist of context sections, Context is King!

### When Executing PRPs

1. **Load PRP**: Read and understand all context and requirements
2. **ULTRATHINK**: Create comprehensive plan, break down into todos, use subagents, batch tool etc check prps/ai_docs/
3. **Execute**: Implement following the blueprint
4. **Validate**: Run each validation command, fix failures
5. **Complete**: Ensure all checklist items done

### Skill Usage

- Access via `$` prefix in Codex (e.g., `$prp-plan implement user auth`)
- Skills are self-documenting with usage examples
- Use parallel skills for rapid development
- Leverage existing review and refactoring skills

```

Remember: This framework is about **one-pass implementation success through comprehensive context and validation**. Every PRP should contain the exact context for an AI agent to successfully implement working code in a single pass.
